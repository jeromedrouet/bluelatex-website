# Compiler API
{:.no_toc}

* Content
{:toc}

This page describes how the paper compilation process is handled inside \BlueLaTeX.

## Background Compilation

Paper compilation in \BlueLaTeX is performed as a background task. No user action is needed anymore.

This task is started when the first author joins the compiler resource of a paper. It is stopped when the last author leaves the compiler resource.

By joining the compiler resource of a paper, the author subscribes to an update stream that sends results of the compilation (either the compiled paper, or the error log).

## Compilation Settings

Each paper may have specific compilation settings. These settings allow people to inform \BlueLaTeX how the compilation is to be performed:

* **compiler** tells \BlueLaTeX which compiler to use to compile the paper (latex, pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex, ...),
* **interval** tells \BlueLaTeX how long (in seconds) it must wait between two recompilations,
* **timeout** tells \BlueLaTeX after what timeout (in seconds) it must stops the current compilation pass, and (possibly) retry.
* ***synctex*** tells \BlueLaTeX to generate SyncTeX data when compiling the paper.

**Parameters:**

Name    | Type | Description
------- | ---- | -----------
page    | int  | The page to render **mandatory**

**Response:**

Code | Value               | Meaning | Headers

A compiler settings object is as follows:
```json
{
  "compiler": "pdflatex",
  "timeout": 30,
  "interval": 15

```

## Trigger Compilation

**Mehtod:** POST

**Path:** _/&lt;api&gt;/papers/&lt;paperid&gt;/compiler_

**Parameters**

Name | Type   | Description
---- | ------ | -----------
name | string | If the user is not authenticated but is allowed to compile the paper, then a unique temporary name must be given **optional**

**Response:**

Code | Value          | Meaning
---- | -------------- | -------
200  | _true_         | The paper was successfully compiled.
304  | _false_        | The paper was not modified since last compilation and was not recompiled
401  | _error object_ | User has no right to compile the paper
500  | _error object_ | Something wrong happened on the server side
503  | _error object_ | No compilation task is started

Depending on the server configuration, sending **POST** request to this resource either triggers a new compilation if none is already started (explicit compilation) or registers to the compilation channel (background compilation). In case of background compilation, the server answers when the last compilation ends. This uses long polling to notify client when the paper is compiled.
